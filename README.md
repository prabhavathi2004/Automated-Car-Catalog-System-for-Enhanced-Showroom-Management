📘 Project Overview

The Automated Car Catalog System is an AI-driven digital solution designed to enhance car showroom operations by integrating intelligent catalog management and customer interaction.

This system helps customers explore, compare, and customize car models through an interactive web or kiosk interface. It uses artificial intelligence to recommend cars based on user preferences such as budget, performance, and fuel type.

The system also assists showroom staff by automatically generating quotations, managing bookings, and tracking vehicle availability — reducing manual workload and improving overall customer experience.

🔍 Smart Search & Filters: Allows users to browse cars based on price, brand, fuel type, engine capacity, or color.

💬 Virtual Assistant Integration: An AI chatbot guides customers through car selection, comparisons, and booking.

🧾 Quotation Generator: Instantly generates car quotations based on selected features and configurations.

📦 Real-Time Stock Monitoring: Updates car availability status automatically as sales and bookings occur.

🛠️ Technologies Used

The system is developed using Python and Flask for backend automation and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the interactive front-end interface.
